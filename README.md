# orcidDemo

This repository contains a web app that demnstrated login utilizing the ORCID API. Currently in the testing phase, it uses the ORCID sandbox API. The issue right now is that there exists some authentication issue at the moment, and as soon as that is resolved, I will use the ORCID Public API and implement the web app completely and then a docker image could be created, as mentioned in the task description.
